# Authendance
For the Global Classroom module in TU Dublin. 2020.

The project “Authendance” is the development of an Android mobile
app.
It’s purpose is to track the attendance of every student and will be
used as evidence for attendance in class. To ensure the physical
attendance, the students have to scan a QR code inside the classroom.
The app will have a login for teachers and one for the students.
After setting up your class dates as a teacher you will be able to
set a code and create a QR code. This has to be done for every class.
Before leaving the classroom students have to scan a created QR code
from the teachers phone. Then the app will confirm the attendance and
write the data of the student in the database.
The teacher can see which student has attended his class and the
student can see his own attendance in the different classes.
