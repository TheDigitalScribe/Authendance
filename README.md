## Description
- Android student attendance tracker app with QR code implementation. 
- Built with Java in Android Studio with Firebase for the backend. 
- App was created in 2020 as part of a group college project. **NB**: This is not currently working as the database was removed.

## How It Works
- Lecturers generate a unique QR code for one of their subjects with the app.
- Students scan the QR code with the app and record their attendance.
- Lecturers can see student attendance records for their modules and students can see their own personal attendance. 
- Admins can see a list of all students and lecturers and the attendance of all students.

## Methodology & Testing
- Used agile methodology, completing tasks in sprints and testing continuously. 
- Consulted with pretend client and gathered feedback to implement. 
- Black-box user testing was conducted towards the end of development. 

## Conclusion
The project turned out to be a success. The scope was properly defined and reached and it works as intended.
